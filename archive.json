By being a particular member of the OSCORE group?)\r\n* How would the client know which multicast address to join?\r\n  * By looking at something https://gitlab.com/crimson84/draft-tiloca-core-observe-responses-multicast/-/issues/2 -ish? Would be unwieldy.\r\n  * Could that derive from the network parameters, possibly the cache-key options as input to a hash? (Eg. such that for `GET coap://[address]/path`, the multicast group in the network `2001:db8::` would become `ff35:30:2001:db8::XXYY` where XXYY is a portion of `hash(address, path)`)\r\n  * Could a client say something about its ability to choose any multicast address in the request?\r\n \r\n----------\r\n\r\nMuch of this hinges on the address selection. Do we have *anything* on how link- and site-wide multicast addresses are selected by applications at all?\r\n\r\n(All I know so far are special-purpose IANA-managed addresses, and that ff35:30:2001:db8::XXYY source-specific-multicast of which I don't even know whether they're actually used.)\r\n",

After all, it might manage to.\r\n\r\nSimple answer is that it is configured to use a proxy, and because of that does not join the group. (Or, even simpler, because it's using a different protocol).\r\n\r\nBut what if it is using a reverse proxy (of whose existence it is unaware)? Then the server could render assistance (mind you, reverse proxies do in general need explicit setup somewhere) like this:\r\n* It sends an empty (or absent) tp_info. This prompts the client to send the observation the same way it would always (because there's no better guidance, but hey, there's now a known-good request).\r\n* The proxy receives the phantom request as a regular unicast request, sends it by unicast, and now we're in a situation as with the deterministic client that the server can act in \"Huh, OSCORE? Never heard of it\" mode and respond with an unprotected 5.03 with tp_info.\r\n* The proxy joins the group as it would in the unprotected or the deterministic case.\r\n\r\nThis has one message exchange more (two unicasts from the proxy), but allows the server to hide its network addresses / topology from clients.\r\n\r\nThis is now possible that we have a good separation between tp_info and ph_req/last_notif, and by the way this is exactly what (if deterministic-oscore still talked about how to get a ticket request) would be used for unicast ticket requests :-)\r\n",

After decryption, the clients can rely on the inner code 5.03 to understand that this is actually about cancelling the group observation.",

Then, the proxy responds to the client, by forwarding back the latest multicast notification.\r\n\r\nOn the first case --- Since 'last_notif' is optional to include in the informative response, it may take some time before the proxy actually receives a notification, and forwards it back to the client. The lifetime of the Token used between client and proxy has to be longer than such an amount of time, or the first following notification would not match anymore on the Client's side when it comes. This can be explicitly noted.\r\n\r\nOn the second case --- It is worth saying explicitly that the forwarded notification includes an Observe option, where the proxy specifies a value consistent with the counter it uses with the observing clients.
